## want to make your (INSERT YOUR DISTRO) to look like mine?


You've come to the right place
get yourself the stealthy-arch experience 
It's mash of things from here and there i'll be sure to update it every 
now and then.

> reminder: the files here should be placed in your Home/USERNAME/ directory

This config uses I3gaps / Xfce4 as its WM

### why both?
    Well initally i wanted my arch to have two window managers
    two for two different purposes
    
    - Developing (i3gaps)
    - Web browsing and general purpose (XFCE4)

### requirements.txt
bash-it 
i3gaps
xfce4
nvim
